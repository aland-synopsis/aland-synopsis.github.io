    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.</p>

    <h5>John 1:1-18</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p>
    <p>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.</p>
    <p>The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
    <p>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, &#x201C;This was he of whom I said, &#x2018;He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.&#x2019;&#x201D;) And from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.</p>

    <h5>Luke 1:5-25</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.</p>
    <p>Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>And Zechariah said to the angel, &#x201C;How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.&#x201D; And the angel answered him, &#x201C;I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.&#x201D; And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.</p>
    <p>After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, &#x201C;Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.&#x201D;</p>

    <h5>Luke 1:26-38</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, &#x201C;Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!&#x201D; But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>And Mary said to the angel, &#x201C;How will this be, since I am a virgin?&#x201D;</p>
    <p>And the angel answered her, &#x201C;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy&#x2014;the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.&#x201D; And Mary said, &#x201C;Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.&#x201D; And the angel departed from her.</p>

    <div class="entry-verses">

    <h5>Luke 1:39-56</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed with a loud cry, &#x201C;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>And Mary said,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;My soul magnifies the Lord,<br/>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,<br/>
    for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.<br/>For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;<br/>
    for he who is mighty has done great things for me,<br/>and holy is his name.<br/>
    And his mercy is for those who fear him<br/>from generation to generation.<br/>
    He has shown strength with his arm;<br/>he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;<br/>
    he has brought down the mighty from their thrones<br/>and exalted those of humble estate;<br/>
    he has filled the hungry with good things,<br/>and the rich he has sent away empty.<br/>
    He has helped his servant Israel,<br/>in remembrance of his mercy,<br/>
    as he spoke to our fathers,<br/>to Abraham and to his offspring forever.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.</p>

    <h5>Luke 1:57-80</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, but his mother answered, &#x201C;No; he shall be called John.&#x201D; And they said to her, &#x201C;None of your relatives is called by this name.&#x201D; And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, &#x201C;His name is John.&#x201D; And they all wondered. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea, and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, &#x201C;What then will this child be?&#x201D; For the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
        <p>And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,<br/>for he has visited and redeemed his people<br/>
    and has raised up a horn of salvation for us<br/>in the house of his servant David,<br/>
    as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,<br/>
    that we should be saved from our enemies<br/>and from the hand of all who hate us;<br/>
    to show the mercy promised to our fathers<br/>and to remember his holy covenant,<br/>
    the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us<br/>that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies,<br/>
    might serve him without fear,<br/>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.<br/>
    And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;<br/>for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,<br/>
    to give knowledge of salvation to his people<br/>in the forgiveness of their sins,<br/>
    because of the tender mercy of our God,<br/>whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high<br/>
    to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,<br/>to guide our feet into the way of peace.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &#x201C;Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&#x201D; All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,<br/>and they shall call his name Immanuel&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>(which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.</p>

    <p>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be registered, each to his own town. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p>

    <p>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, &#x201C;Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.&#x201D; When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, &#x201C;In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;&#x2018;And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,<br/>are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br/>
    for from you shall come a ruler<br/>who will shepherd my people Israel.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, &#x201C;Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.&#x201D; After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</p>

    <h5>Luke 2:21-38</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
        <p>And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, &#x201C;Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord&#x201D;) and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, &#x201C;a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.&#x201D; Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace,<br/>according to your word;<br/>
    for my eyes have seen your salvation<br/>that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,<br/>
    a light for revelation to the Gentiles,<br/>and for glory to your people Israel.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, &#x201C;Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>

This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, &#x201C;Out of Egypt I called my son.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</p>

His parents did not know it, but supposing him to be in the group they went a day's journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, &#x201C;Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Why were you looking for me?

    <h5>Matthew 4:1-11</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. And the tempter came and said to him, &#x201C;If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.&#x201D; But he answered, <span>&#x201C;It is written,</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2018;Man shall not live by bread alone,<br/>but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>
    <p>Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, &#x201C;If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;&#x2018;He will command his angels concerning you,&#x2019;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;&#x2018;On their hands they will bear you up,<br/>lest you strike your foot against a stone.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Again it is written, &#x2018;You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span> Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, &#x201C;All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.&#x201D; Then Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Be gone, Satan! For it is written,</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2018;You shall worship the Lord your God<br/>and him only shall you serve.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>
    <p>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.</p>

    <h5>Mark 1:12-13</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.</p>

    <h5>Luke 4:1-13</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry. The devil said to him, &#x201C;If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.&#x201D; And Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;It is written, &#x2018;Man shall not live by bread alone.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span> And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said to him, &#x201C;To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.&#x201D; And Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;It is written,</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2018;You shall worship the Lord your God,<br/>and him only shall you serve.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>
    <p>And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, &#x201C;If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;&#x2018;He will command his angels concerning you,<br/>to guard you,&#x2019;</p></blockquote>
    <p>and</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;&#x2018;On their hands they will bear you up,<br/>lest you strike your foot against a stone.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>And Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;It is said, &#x2018;You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span> And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.</p>
