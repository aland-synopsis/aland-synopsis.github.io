    <p>Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.</p>

    <h5>John 1:1-18</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p>
    <p>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.</p>
    <p>The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
    <p>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, &#x201C;This was he of whom I said, &#x2018;He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.&#x2019;&#x201D;) And from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.</p>

    <div class="entry-verses">

    <h5>Luke 1:5-25</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.</p>
    <p>Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>And Zechariah said to the angel, &#x201C;How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.&#x201D; And the angel answered him, &#x201C;I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.&#x201D; And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.</p>
    <p>After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, &#x201C;Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.&#x201D;</p>

    <p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, &#x201C;Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!&#x201D; But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>And Mary said to the angel, &#x201C;How will this be, since I am a virgin?&#x201D;</p>
    <p>And the angel answered her, &#x201C;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy&#x2014;the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.&#x201D; And Mary said, &#x201C;Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.&#x201D; And the angel departed from her.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed with a loud cry, &#x201C;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>And Mary said,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;My soul magnifies the Lord,<br/>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,<br/>
    for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.<br/>For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;<br/>
    for he who is mighty has done great things for me,<br/>and holy is his name.<br/>
    And his mercy is for those who fear him<br/>from generation to generation.<br/>
    He has shown strength with his arm;<br/>he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;<br/>
    he has brought down the mighty from their thrones<br/>and exalted those of humble estate;<br/>
    he has filled the hungry with good things,<br/>and the rich he has sent away empty.<br/>
    He has helped his servant Israel,<br/>in remembrance of his mercy,<br/>

    <p>Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, but his mother answered, &#x201C;No; he shall be called John.&#x201D; And they said to her, &#x201C;None of your relatives is called by this name.&#x201D; And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, &#x201C;His name is John.&#x201D; And they all wondered. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea, and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, &#x201C;What then will this child be?&#x201D; For the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
        <p>And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</p>

    <p>&#x201C;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,<br/>for he has visited and redeemed his people<br/>
    and has raised up a horn of salvation for us<br/>in the house of his servant David,<br/>
    as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,<br/>
    that we should be saved from our enemies<br/>and from the hand of all who hate us;<br/>
    to show the mercy promised to our fathers<br/>and to remember his holy covenant,<br/>
    the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us<br/>that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies,<br/>
    might serve him without fear,<br/>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.<br/>
    And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;<br/>for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,<br/>
    to give knowledge of salvation to his people<br/>in the forgiveness of their sins,<br/>
    because of the tender mercy of our God,<br/>whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high<br/>
    to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,<br/>to guide our feet into the way of peace.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &#x201C;Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&#x201D; All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,<br/>and they shall call his name Immanuel&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>(which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.</p>

And all went to be registered, each to his own town. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p>

    <p>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, &#x201C;Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.&#x201D; When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, &#x201C;In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;&#x2018;And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,<br/>are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br/>
    for from you shall come a ruler<br/>who will shepherd my people Israel.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, &#x201C;Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.&#x201D; After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</p>

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.&#x201D; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Glory to God in the highest,<br/>and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &#x201C;Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.&#x201D; And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</p>

    <p>And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
        <p>And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, &#x201C;Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord&#x201D;) and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, &#x201C;a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.&#x201D; Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace,<br/>according to your word;<br/>
    for my eyes have seen your salvation<br/>that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,<br/>
    a light for revelation to the Gentiles,<br/>and for glory to your people Israel.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, &#x201C;Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, &#x201C;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&#x201D; For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;The voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br/>
    &#x2018;Prepare the way of the Lord;<br/>make his paths straight.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Mark 1:2-6</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Behold, I send my messenger before your face,<br/>who will prepare your way,<br/>
    the voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br/>&#x2018;Prepare the way of the Lord,<br/>make his paths straight,&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.</p>

    <h5>Luke 3:1-6</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;The voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br/>
    &#x2018;Prepare the way of the Lord,<br/>make his paths straight.<br/>
    Every valley shall be filled,<br/>and every mountain and hill shall be made low,<br/>
    and the crooked shall become straight,<br/>and the rough places shall become level ways,<br/>

    <h5>John 1:19-23</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, &#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D; He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, &#x201C;I am not the Christ.&#x201D; And they asked him, &#x201C;What then? Are you Elijah?&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;I am not.&#x201D; &#x201C;Are you the Prophet?&#x201D; And he answered, &#x201C;No.&#x201D; So they said to him, &#x201C;Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, &#x2018;Make straight the way of the Lord,&#x2019; as the prophet Isaiah said.&#x201D;</p>

    <h5>John 1:35-51</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, &#x201C;Behold, the Lamb of God!&#x201D; The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, <span>&#x201C;What are you seeking?&#x201D;</span> And they said to him, &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D; (which means Teacher), &#x201C;where are you staying?&#x201D; He said to them, <span>&#x201C;Come and you will see.&#x201D;</span> So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, &#x201C;We have found the Messiah&#x201D; (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, <span>&#x201C;So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas&#x201D;</span> (which means Peter).</p>
        <p>The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, <span>&#x201C;Follow me.&#x201D;</span> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael and said to him, &#x201C;We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&#x201D; Nathanael said to him, &#x201C;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&#x201D; Philip said to him, &#x201C;Come and see.&#x201D; Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, <span>&#x201C;Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!&#x201D;</span> Nathanael said to him, &#x201C;How do you know me?&#x201D; Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&#x201D;</span> Nathanael answered him, &#x201C;Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!&#x201D; Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;Because I said to you, &#x2018;I saw you under the fig tree,&#x2019; do you believe? You will see greater things than these.&#x201D;</span> And he said to him, <span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <p>On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, &#x201C;They have no wine.&#x201D; And Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.&#x201D;</span> His mother said to the servants, &#x201C;Do whatever he tells you.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, <span>&#x201C;Fill the jars with water.&#x201D;</span> And they filled them up to the brim. And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.&#x201D;</span> So they took it. When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, &#x201C;Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.&#x201D; This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</p>

    <h5>John 3:1-21</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, &#x201C;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.&#x201D; Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#x201D;</span> Nicodemus said to him, &#x201C;How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?&#x201D; Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span>Do not marvel that I said to you, &#x2018;You must be born again.&#x2019;</span> <span>The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>Nicodemus said to him, &#x201C;How can these things be?&#x201D; Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things?</span> <span>Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony.</span> <span>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</span> <span>No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.</span> <span>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</span> <span>that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.</span></p>
        <p><span>&#x201C;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</span> <span>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.</span> <span>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</span> <span>And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.</span> <span>For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.</span> <span>But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <p>John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized (for John had not yet been put in prison).</p>
    <p>Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purification. And they came to John and said to him, &#x201C;Rabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witness&#x2014;look, he is baptizing, and all are going to him.&#x201D; John answered, &#x201C;A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, &#x2018;I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.&#x2019; The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete. He must increase, but I must decrease.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all. He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony. Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.</p>

    <h5>John 4:4-42</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And he had to pass through Samaria. So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p>
    <p>A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Give me a drink.&#x201D;</span> (For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, &#x201C;How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?&#x201D; (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, <span>&#x201C;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, &#x2018;Give me a drink,&#x2019; you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.&#x201D;</span> The woman said to him, &#x201C;Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.&#x201D; Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,</span> <span>but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.&#x201D;</span> The woman said to him, &#x201C;Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Go, call your husband, and come here.&#x201D;</span> The woman answered him, &#x201C;I have no husband.&#x201D; Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;You are right in saying, &#x2018;I have no husband&#x2019;;</span> <span>for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.&#x201D;</span> The woman said to him, &#x201C;Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.&#x201D; Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</span> <span>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span>But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</span> <span>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.&#x201D;</span> The woman said to him, &#x201C;I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.&#x201D; Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;I who speak to you am he.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, &#x201C;What do you seek?&#x201D; or, &#x201C;Why are you talking with her?&#x201D; So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people, &#x201C;Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?&#x201D; They went out of the town and were coming to him.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, &#x201C;Rabbi, eat.&#x201D; But he said to them, <span>&#x201C;I have food to eat that you do not know about.&#x201D;</span> So the disciples said to one another, &#x201C;Has anyone brought him something to eat?&#x201D; Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.</span> <span>Do you not say, &#x2018;There are yet four months, then comes the harvest&#x2019;? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest.</span> <span>Already</span> <span>the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</span> <span>For here the saying holds true, &#x2018;One sows and another reaps.&#x2019;</span> <span>I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, &#x201C;He told me all that I ever did.&#x201D; So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. And many more believed because of his word. They said to the woman, &#x201C;It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.&#x201D;</p>

    <p>And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</p>

    the people dwelling in darkness<br/>have seen a great light,<br/>
    and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death,<br/>on them a light has dawned.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>

    <p>After the two days he departed for Galilee. (For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.) So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast.</p>
        <p>So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br/>because he has anointed me<br/>to proclaim good news to the poor.<br/>
    He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives<br/>and recovering of sight to the blind,<br/>to set at liberty those who are oppressed,</span><br/><span>to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>
    <p>And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, <span>&#x201C;Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&#x201D;</span> And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said, &#x201C;Is not this Joseph's son?&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, &#x2018;Physician, heal yourself.&#x2019; What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.&#x201D;</span> And he said, <span>&#x201C;Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.</span> <span>But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land,</span> <span>and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.</span> <span>And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.&#x201D;</span> When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.

Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span>&#x201C;Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&#x201D;</span> And Simon answered, &#x201C;Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.&#x201D; And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, &#x201C;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&#x201D; For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, &#x201C;Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.&#x201D; And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <span>&#x201C;I will; be clean.&#x201D;</span> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them.&#x201D;</span></p>
    </div>

    <h5>Mark 1:40-45</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, &#x201C;If you will, you can make me clean.&#x201D; Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, <span>&#x201C;I will; be clean.&#x201D;</span> And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, and said to him, <span>&#x201C;See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.&#x201D;</span> But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, &#x201C;Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.&#x201D; And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <span>&#x201C;I will; be clean.&#x201D;</span> And immediately the leprosy left him. And he charged him to tell no one, but <span>&#x201C;go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to them.&#x201D;</span> But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities. But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.</p>

    <p>And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them. And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <span>&#x201C;Son, your sins are forgiven.&#x201D;</span> Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, &#x201C;Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#x201D; And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, <span>&#x201C;Why do you question these things in your hearts?</span> <span>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, &#x2018;Your sins are forgiven,&#x2019; or to say, &#x2018;Rise, take up your bed and walk&#x2019;?</span> <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;he said to the paralytic&#x2014; <span>&#x201C;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.&#x201D;</span> And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, &#x201C;We never saw anything like this!&#x201D;</p>

And behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus, but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus. And when he saw their faith, he said, <span>&#x201C;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&#x201D;</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, &#x201C;Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#x201D; When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, <span>&#x201C;Why do you question in your hearts?</span> <span>Which is easier, to say, &#x2018;Your sins are forgiven you,&#x2019; or to say, &#x2018;Rise and walk&#x2019;?</span> <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;he said to the man who was paralyzed&#x2014;<span>&#x201C;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.&#x201D;</span> And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God.

    <p>On another Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered.

But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man with the withered hand, <span>&#x201C;Come and stand here.&#x201D;</span> And he rose and stood there.

Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</span> <span>Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?</span> <span>And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?</span> <span>And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin,</span> <span>yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span>But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</span> <span>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, &#x2018;What shall we eat?&#x2019; or &#x2018;What shall we drink?&#x2019; or &#x2018;What shall we wear?&#x2019;</span> <span>For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.</span> <span>But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</span></p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them. And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.</p>
        <p>Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.</p>
        <p>And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him. And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him, for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, &#x201C;You are the Son of God.&#x201D; And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.</p>
        <p>And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.</p>

And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him, &#x201C;Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly.&#x201D; And he said to him, <span>&#x201C;I will come and heal him.&#x201D;</span> But the centurion replied, &#x201C;Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, &#x2018;Go,&#x2019; and he goes, and to another, &#x2018;Come,&#x2019; and he comes, and to my servant, &#x2018;Do this,&#x2019; and he does it.&#x201D; When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, <span>&#x201C;Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith.</span> <span>I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,</span> <span>while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#x201D;</span> And to the centurion Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.&#x201D;</span> And the servant was healed at that very moment.</p>

    <p>After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly valued by him. When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, &#x201C;He is worthy to have you do this for him, for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue.&#x201D; And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, &#x201C;Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed. For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, &#x2018;Go,&#x2019; and he goes; and to another, &#x2018;Come,&#x2019; and he comes; and to my servant, &#x2018;Do this,&#x2019; and he does it.&#x201D; When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, <span>&#x201C;I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.&#x201D;</span> And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill. When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. So Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.&#x201D;</span> The official said to him, &#x201C;Sir, come down before my child dies.&#x201D; Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Go; your son will live.&#x201D;</span> The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way. As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering. So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, &#x201C;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&#x201D; The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, <span>&#x201C;Your son will live.&#x201D;</span> And he himself believed, and all his household. This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</p>

    <p>Soon afterward he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him.

And he said, <span>&#x201C;Young man, I say to you, arise.&#x201D;</span> And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.

    <p>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit. He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones. And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him. And crying out with a loud voice, he said, &#x201C;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.&#x201D; For he was saying to him, <span>&#x201C;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&#x201D;</span> And Jesus asked him, <span>&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D;</span> He replied, &#x201C;My name is Legion, for we are many.&#x201D; And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country. Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him, saying, &#x201C;Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.&#x201D; So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the pigs, and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea.</p>
    <p>The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened. And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs. And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region. As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him. And he did not permit him but said to him, <span>&#x201C;Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.&#x201D;</span> And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.</p>

    <h5>Luke 8:26-39</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, &#x201C;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.&#x201D; For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.) Jesus then asked him, <span>&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D;</span> And he said, &#x201C;Legion,&#x201D; for many demons had entered him. And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</p>
    <p>When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country. Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed. Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <span>&#x201C;Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.&#x201D;</span> And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</p>

    <p>And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city. And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <span>&#x201C;Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.&#x201D;</span> And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, &#x201C;This man is blaspheming.&#x201D; But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, <span>&#x201C;Why do you think evil in your hearts?</span> <span>For which is easier, to say, &#x2018;Your sins are forgiven,&#x2019; or to say, &#x2018;Rise and walk&#x2019;?</span> <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;he then said to the paralytic&#x2014;<span>&#x201C;Rise, pick up your bed and go home.&#x201D;</span> And he rose and went home.

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them. And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <span>&#x201C;Son, your sins are forgiven.&#x201D;</span> Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, &#x201C;Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#x201D; And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, <span>&#x201C;Why do you question these things in your hearts?</span> <span>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, &#x2018;Your sins are forgiven,&#x2019; or to say, &#x2018;Rise, take up your bed and walk&#x2019;?</span> <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;he said to the paralytic&#x2014; <span>&#x201C;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.&#x201D;</span> And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, &#x201C;We never saw anything like this!&#x201D;</p>

    <p>On one of those days, as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with him to heal. And behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus, but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus. And when he saw their faith, he said, <span>&#x201C;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&#x201D;</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, &#x201C;Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#x201D; When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, <span>&#x201C;Why do you question in your hearts?</span> <span>Which is easier, to say, &#x2018;Your sins are forgiven you,&#x2019; or to say, &#x2018;Rise and walk&#x2019;?</span> <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;he said to the man who was paralyzed&#x2014;<span>&#x201C;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.&#x201D;</span> And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God.

    <p>While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, &#x201C;My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.&#x201D; And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples. And behold, a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, for she said to herself, &#x201C;If I only touch his garment, I will be made well.&#x201D; Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, <span>&#x201C;Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.&#x201D;</span> And instantly the woman was made well. And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, he said, <span>&#x201C;Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.&#x201D;</span> And they laughed at him. But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. And the report of this went through all that district.</p>

    <h5>Mark 5:21-43</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea. Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet and implored him earnestly, saying, &#x201C;My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.&#x201D; And he went with him.</p>
    <p>And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. For she said, &#x201C;If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.&#x201D; And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, <span>&#x201C;Who touched my garments?&#x201D;</span> And his disciples said to him, &#x201C;You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, <span>&#x2018;Who touched me?&#x2019;</span>&#x201D; And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. And he said to her, <span>&#x201C;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, &#x201C;Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?&#x201D; But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, <span>&#x201C;Do not fear, only believe.&#x201D;</span> And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. And when he had entered, he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.&#x201D;</span> And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was. Taking her by the hand he said to her, <span>&#x201C;Talitha cumi,&#x201D;</span> which means, <span>&#x201C;Little girl, I say to you, arise.&#x201D;</span> And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement. And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Luke 8:40-56</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. And there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus' feet, he implored him to come to his house, for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.</p>
    <p>As Jesus went, the people pressed around him. And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her living on physicians, she could not be healed by anyone. She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her discharge of blood ceased. And Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Who was it that touched me?&#x201D;</span> When all denied it, Peter said, &#x201C;Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!&#x201D; But Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out from me.&#x201D;</span> And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed. And he said to her, <span>&#x201C;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>While he was still speaking, someone from the ruler's house came and said, &#x201C;Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.&#x201D; But Jesus on hearing this answered him, <span>&#x201C;Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well.&#x201D;</span> And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. And all were weeping and mourning for her, but he said, <span>&#x201C;Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping.&#x201D;</span> And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. But taking her by the hand he called, saying, <span>&#x201C;Child, arise.&#x201D;</span> And her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat. And her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.</p>

Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, &#x201C;If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.&#x201D; And Jesus answering said to him, <span>&#x201C;Simon, I have something to say to you.&#x201D;</span> And he answered, &#x201C;Say it, Teacher.&#x201D;</p>

But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said, &#x201C;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&#x201D; He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it. Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial.</span> <span>For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <p>Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. And all the people were amazed, and said, &#x201C;Can this be the Son of David?&#x201D; But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, &#x201C;It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.&#x201D; Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand.</span> <span>And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</span> <span>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.</span> <span>But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> <span>Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.</span> <span>Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</span></p>

    <p>And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way.

    <p>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit. He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones. And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him. And crying out with a loud voice, he said, &#x201C;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.&#x201D; For he was saying to him, <span>&#x201C;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&#x201D;</span> And Jesus asked him, <span>&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D;</span> He replied, &#x201C;My name is Legion, for we are many.&#x201D; And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country. Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him, saying, &#x201C;Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.&#x201D; So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the pigs, and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea.</p>
    <p>The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened. And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs. And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region. As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him. And he did not permit him but said to him, <span>&#x201C;Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.&#x201D;</span> And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.</p>

    <p>Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, &#x201C;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.&#x201D; For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.) Jesus then asked him, <span>&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D;</span> And he said, &#x201C;Legion,&#x201D; for many demons had entered him. And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss. Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</p>
    <p>When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country. Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed. Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <span>&#x201C;Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.&#x201D;</span> And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</p>

And behold, a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, for she said to herself, &#x201C;If I only touch his garment, I will be made well.&#x201D; Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, <span>&#x201C;Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.&#x201D;</span> And instantly the woman was made well. And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, he said, <span>&#x201C;Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.&#x201D;</span> And they laughed at him. But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. And the report of this went through all that district.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea. Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet and implored him earnestly, saying, &#x201C;My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.&#x201D; And he went with him.</p>
    <p>And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. For she said, &#x201C;If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.&#x201D; And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, <span>&#x201C;Who touched my garments?&#x201D;</span> And his disciples said to him, &#x201C;You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, <span>&#x2018;Who touched me?&#x2019;</span>&#x201D; And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. And he said to her, <span>&#x201C;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, &#x201C;Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?&#x201D; But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, <span>&#x201C;Do not fear, only believe.&#x201D;</span> And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. And when he had entered, he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.&#x201D;</span> And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was. Taking her by the hand he said to her, <span>&#x201C;Talitha cumi,&#x201D;</span> which means, <span>&#x201C;Little girl, I say to you, arise.&#x201D;</span> And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement. And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</p>

    <p>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. And there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus' feet, he implored him to come to his house, for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.</p>
    <p>As Jesus went, the people pressed around him. And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her living on physicians, she could not be healed by anyone. She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her discharge of blood ceased. And Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Who was it that touched me?&#x201D;</span> When all denied it, Peter said, &#x201C;Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!&#x201D; But Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out from me.&#x201D;</span> And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed. And he said to her, <span>&#x201C;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>While he was still speaking, someone from the ruler's house came and said, &#x201C;Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.&#x201D; But Jesus on hearing this answered him, <span>&#x201C;Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well.&#x201D;</span> And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. And all were weeping and mourning for her, but he said, <span>&#x201C;Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping.&#x201D;</span> And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. But taking her by the hand he called, saying, <span>&#x201C;Child, arise.&#x201D;</span> And her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat. And her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.</p>

    <p>And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there, and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, &#x201C;Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?&#x201D; And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.&#x201D;</span> And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</p>

    <p>He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, &#x201C;Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?&#x201D; And they took offense at him. And Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.&#x201D;</span> And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them. And he marveled because of their unbelief.</p>
    <p>And he went about among the villages teaching.</p>

    <h5>Luke 4:16-30</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read. And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br/>because he has anointed me<br/>to proclaim good news to the poor.<br/>
    He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives<br/>and recovering of sight to the blind,<br/>to set at liberty those who are oppressed,</span><br/><span>to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>
    <p>And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, <span>&#x201C;Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&#x201D;</span> And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said, &#x201C;Is not this Joseph's son?&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, &#x2018;Physician, heal yourself.&#x2019; What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.&#x201D;</span> And he said, <span>&#x201C;Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.</span> <span>But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land,</span> <span>and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.</span> <span>And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.&#x201D;</span> When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. But passing through their midst, he went away.</p>

    </p>

    <div class="entry-verses">

    <h5>John 5:2-47</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades. In these lay a multitude of invalids&#x2014;blind, lame, and paralyzed. One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, <span>&#x201C;Do you want to be healed?&#x201D;</span> The sick man answered him, &#x201C;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.&#x201D; Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Get up, take up your bed, and walk.&#x201D;</span> And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.</p>
    <p>Now that day was the Sabbath. So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, &#x201C;It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.&#x201D; But he answered them, &#x201C;The man who healed me, that man said to me, <span>&#x2018;Take up your bed, and walk.&#x2019;</span>&#x201D; They asked him, &#x201C;Who is the man who said to you, &#x2018;Take up your bed and walk&#x2019;?&#x201D; Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, <span>&#x201C;See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.&#x201D;</span> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. But Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;My Father is working until now, and I am working.&#x201D;</span></p>
        <p>This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
        <p>So Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.</span> <span>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel.</span> <span>For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will.</span> <span>The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</span> <span>that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <span>Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</span> <span>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.</span> <span>And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</span> <span>Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</span> <span>and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.</span></p>
        <p><span>&#x201C;I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span>If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not deemed true.</span> <span>There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true.</span> <span>You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</span> <span>Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.</span> <span>He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</span> <span>But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me.</span> <span>And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen,</span> <span>and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent.</span> <span>You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me,</span> <span>yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</span> <span>I do not receive glory from people.</span> <span>But I know that you do not have the love of God within you.</span> <span>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.</span> <span>How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?</span> <span>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope.</span> <span>For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me.</span> <span>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?&#x201D;</span></p>

    <p>But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, &#x201C;Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.&#x201D; And he vowed to her, &#x201C;Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.&#x201D; And she went out and said to her mother, &#x201C;For what should I ask?&#x201D; And she said, &#x201C;The head of John the Baptist.&#x201D; And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, &#x201C;I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&#x201D; And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her.

    <p>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, &#x201C;This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.&#x201D; But Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;They need not go away; you give them something to eat.&#x201D;</span> They said to him, &#x201C;We have only five loaves here and two fish.&#x201D; And he said, <span>&#x201C;Bring them here to me.&#x201D;</span> Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p>

    <p>And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, &#x201C;This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late. Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.&#x201D; But he answered them, <span>&#x201C;You give them something to eat.&#x201D;</span> And they said to him, &#x201C;Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;How many loaves do you have? Go and see.&#x201D;</span> And when they had found out, they said, &#x201C;Five, and two fish.&#x201D; Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.

Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, &#x201C;Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.&#x201D; But he said to them, <span>&#x201C;You give them something to eat.&#x201D;</span> They said, &#x201C;We have no more than five loaves and two fish&#x2014;unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.&#x201D; For there were about five thousand men.

    <p>After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias. And a large crowd was following him, because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick. Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples. Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. Lifting up his eyes, then, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him, Jesus said to Philip, <span>&#x201C;Where are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?&#x201D;</span> He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he would do. Philip answered him, &#x201C;Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little.&#x201D; One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him, &#x201C;There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they for so many?&#x201D; Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Have the people sit down.&#x201D;</span> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, about five thousand in number. Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted. And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, <span>&#x201C;Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost.&#x201D;</span> So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten. When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, &#x201C;This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!&#x201D;</p>
    <p>Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</p>

    <p>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.

When evening came, he was there alone, but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them. And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, &#x201C;It is a ghost!&#x201D; and they cried out in fear. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span>&#x201C;Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <h5>John 6:26-59</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</span> <span>Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal.&#x201D;</span> Then they said to him, &#x201C;What must we do, to be doing the works of God?&#x201D; Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.&#x201D;</span> So they said to him, &#x201C;Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, &#x2018;He gave them bread from heaven to eat.&#x2019;&#x201D; Jesus then said to them, <span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span> <span>For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.&#x201D;</span> They said to him, &#x201C;Sir, give us this bread always.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.</span> <span>But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</span> <span>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.</span> <span>For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span>And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.</span> <span>For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, <span>&#x201C;I am the bread that came down from heaven.&#x201D;</span> They said, &#x201C;Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, <span>&#x2018;I have come down from heaven&#x2019;</span>?&#x201D; Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;Do not grumble among yourselves.</span> <span>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.</span> <span>It is written in the Prophets, &#x2018;And they will all be taught by God.&#x2019; Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me&#x2014;</span> <span>not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.</span> <span>Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life.</span> <span>I am the bread of life.</span> <span>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</span> <span>This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.</span> <span>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, &#x201C;How can this man give us his flesh to eat?&#x201D; So Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</span> <span>Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</span> <span>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</span> <span>Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.</span> <span>As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me.</span> <span>This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers ate and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.&#x201D;</span> Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, &#x201C;Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.&#x201D; He answered them, <span>&#x201C;And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?</span> <span>For God commanded, &#x2018;Honor your father and your mother,&#x2019; and, &#x2018;Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.&#x2019;</span> <span>But you say, &#x2018;If anyone tells his father or his mother, &#x201C;What you would have gained from me is given to God,&#x201D;</span> <span>he need not honor his father.&#x2019;</span> <span>So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God.</span> <span>You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2018;This people honors me with their lips,<br/>but their heart is far from me;</span><br/><span>in vain do they worship me,<br/>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>
        <p>And he called the people to him and said to them, <span>&#x201C;Hear and understand:</span> <span>it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.&#x201D;</span> Then the disciples came and said to him, &#x201C;Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?&#x201D; He answered, <span>&#x201C;Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</span> <span>Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.&#x201D;</span> But Peter said to him, &#x201C;Explain the parable to us.&#x201D; And he said, <span>&#x201C;Are you also still without understanding?</span> <span>Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled?</span> <span>But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.</span> <span>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander.</span> <span>These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone.&#x201D;</span></p>
    </div>

    <h5>Mark 7:1-23</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands, holding to the tradition of the elders, and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.) And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, &#x201C;Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2018;This people honors me with their lips,<br/>but their heart is far from me;</span><br/><span>in vain do they worship me,<br/>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.&#x2019;</span></p></blockquote>
    <p><span>You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition!</span> <span>For Moses said, &#x2018;Honor your father and your mother&#x2019;; and, &#x2018;Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.&#x2019;</span> <span>But you say, &#x2018;If a man tells his father or his mother, &#x201C;Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban&#x201D;&#x2019; (that is, given to God)&#x2014;</span> <span>then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother,</span> <span>thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do.&#x201D;</span></p>
        <p>And he called the people to him again and said to them, <span>&#x201C;Hear me, all of you, and understand:</span> <span>There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.&#x201D;</span> And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable. And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him,</span> <span>since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?&#x201D;</span> (Thus he declared all foods clean.) And he said, <span>&#x201C;What comes out of a person is what defiles him.</span> <span>For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</span> <span>coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.</span> <span>All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.&#x201D;</span></p>

And Peter said to Jesus, &#x201C;Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#x201D; He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, &#x201C;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.&#x201D; When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, <span>&#x201C;Rise, and have no fear.&#x201D;</span> And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</p>

And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. And Peter said to Jesus, &#x201C;Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#x201D; For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified. And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, &#x201C;This is my beloved Son; listen to him.&#x201D; And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.</p>
    <p>And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean.</p>

    <p>Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white. And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, &#x201C;Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah&#x201D;&#x2014;not knowing what he said. As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &#x201C;This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!&#x201D; And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</p>

And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, &#x201C;Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&#x201D; But he turned and rebuked them.

    <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2018;This people honors me with their lips,<br/>but their heart is far from me;</span><br/><span>in vain do they worship me,<br/>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.&#x2019;</span></p></blockquote>
    <p><span>You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>While Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at table. The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner. And the Lord said to him, <span>&#x201C;Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</span> <span>You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?</span> <span>But give as alms those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you.</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.</span> <span>Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</span> <span>Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>One of the lawyers answered him, &#x201C;Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also.&#x201D; And he said, <span>&#x201C;Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <span>Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.</span> <span>So you are witnesses and you consent to the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs.</span> <span>Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, &#x2018;I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,&#x2019;</span> <span>so that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,</span> <span>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.</span> <span>Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke him to speak about many things, lying in wait for him, to catch him in something he might say.</p>

    <p><span>&#x201C;Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning,</span> <span>and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks.</span> <span>Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them.</span> <span>If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants!</span> <span>But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into.</span> <span>You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>Peter said, &#x201C;Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?&#x201D; And the Lord said, <span>&#x201C;Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?</span> <span>Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.</span> <span>Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.</span> <span>But if that servant says to himself, &#x2018;My master is delayed in coming,&#x2019; and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,</span> <span>the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful.</span> <span>And that servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating.</span> <span>But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.</span></p>

    <p>One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were watching him carefully. And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy. And Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, <span>&#x201C;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?&#x201D;</span> But they remained silent. Then he took him and healed him and sent him away.

    <p>About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. The Jews therefore marveled, saying, &#x201C;How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?&#x201D; So Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</span> <span>If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.</span> <span>The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</span> <span>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?&#x201D;</span> The crowd answered, &#x201C;You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?&#x201D; Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;I did one work, and you all marvel at it.</span> <span>Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> <span>If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</span> <span>Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.&#x201D;</span></p>
        <p>Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, &#x201C;Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.&#x201D; So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, <span>&#x201C;You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord. He who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</span> <span>I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.&#x201D;</span> So they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. Yet many of the people believed in him. They said, &#x201C;When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?&#x201D;</p>
        <p>The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. Jesus then said, <span>&#x201C;I will be with you a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.</span> <span>You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come.&#x201D;</span> The Jews said to one another, &#x201C;Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? What does he mean by saying, <span>&#x2018;You will seek me and you will not find me,&#x2019;</span> and, <span>&#x2018;Where I am you cannot come&#x2019;</span>?&#x201D;</p>
        <p>On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, <span>&#x201C;If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</span> <span>Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, &#x2018;Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span> Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>

Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?&#x201D; This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him.

But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.

    <h5>John 9:1-41</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. And his disciples asked him, &#x201C;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&#x201D; Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.</span> <span>We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.</span> <span>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&#x201D;</span> Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud and said to him, <span>&#x201C;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&#x201D;</span> (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.</p>
    <p>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, &#x201C;Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?&#x201D; Some said, &#x201C;It is he.&#x201D; Others said, &#x201C;No, but he is like him.&#x201D; He kept saying, &#x201C;I am the man.&#x201D; So they said to him, &#x201C;Then how were your eyes opened?&#x201D; He answered, &#x201C;The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, <span>&#x2018;Go to Siloam and wash.&#x2019;</span> So I went and washed and received my sight.&#x201D; They said to him, &#x201C;Where is he?&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;I do not know.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, &#x201C;He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&#x201D; Some of the Pharisees said, &#x201C;This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.&#x201D; But others said, &#x201C;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&#x201D; And there was a division among them. So they said again to the blind man, &#x201C;What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;He is a prophet.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked them, &#x201C;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&#x201D; His parents answered, &#x201C;We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.&#x201D; (His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.) Therefore his parents said, &#x201C;He is of age; ask him.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, &#x201C;Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.&#x201D; He answered, &#x201C;Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&#x201D; They said to him, &#x201C;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&#x201D; He answered them, &#x201C;I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?&#x201D; And they reviled him, saying, &#x201C;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.&#x201D; The man answered, &#x201C;Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&#x201D; They answered him, &#x201C;You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?&#x201D; And they cast him out.</p>
    <p>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, <span>&#x201C;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&#x201D;</span> He answered, &#x201C;And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?&#x201D; Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.&#x201D;</span> He said, &#x201C;Lord, I believe,&#x201D; and he worshiped him. Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.&#x201D;</span> Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, &#x201C;Are we also blind?&#x201D; Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, &#x2018;We see,&#x2019; your guilt remains.</span></p>

    <p><span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber.</span> <span>But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span> <span>To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</span> <span>When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</span> <span>A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.&#x201D;</span> This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.</p>
    <p>So Jesus again said to them, <span>&#x201C;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span> <span>All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</span> <span>I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> <span>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.</span> <span>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <span>He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</span> <span>He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</span> <span>I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,</span> <span>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span>And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.</span> <span>For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.</span> <span>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <p>At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, &#x201C;How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.&#x201D; Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,</span> <span>but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock.</span> <span>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span>I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.</span> <span>I and the Father are one.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?&#x201D;</span> The Jews answered him, &#x201C;It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.&#x201D; Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;Is it not written in your Law, &#x2018;I said, you are gods&#x2019;?</span> <span>If he called them gods to whom the word of God came&#x2014;and Scripture cannot be broken&#x2014;</span> <span>do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, &#x2018;You are blaspheming,&#x2019; because I said, &#x2018;I am the Son of God&#x2019;?</span> <span>If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;</span> <span>but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.&#x201D;</span> Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.</p>

    <h5>John 11:1-44</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. So the sisters sent to him, saying, &#x201C;Lord, he whom you love is ill.&#x201D; But when Jesus heard it he said, <span>&#x201C;This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. Then after this he said to the disciples, <span>&#x201C;Let us go to Judea again.&#x201D;</span> The disciples said to him, &#x201C;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?&#x201D; Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <span>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&#x201D;</span> After saying these things, he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.&#x201D;</span> The disciples said to him, &#x201C;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&#x201D; Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, <span>&#x201C;Lazarus has died,</span> <span>and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.&#x201D;</span> So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, &#x201C;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house. Martha said to Jesus, &#x201C;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.&#x201D; Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Your brother will rise again.&#x201D;</span> Martha said to him, &#x201C;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.&#x201D; Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,</span> <span>and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?&#x201D;</span> She said to him, &#x201C;Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, &#x201C;The Teacher is here and is calling for you.&#x201D; And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, &#x201C;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&#x201D; When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled. And he said, <span>&#x201C;Where have you laid him?&#x201D;</span> They said to him, &#x201C;Lord, come and see.&#x201D; Jesus wept. So the Jews said, &#x201C;See how he loved him!&#x201D; But some of them said, &#x201C;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?&#x201D;</p>
        <p>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Take away the stone.&#x201D;</span> Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, &#x201C;Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.&#x201D; Jesus said to her, <span>&#x201C;Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?&#x201D;</span> So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, <span>&#x201C;Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span> <span>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.&#x201D;</span> When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, <span>&#x201C;Lazarus, come out.&#x201D;</span> The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Unbind him, and let him go.&#x201D;</span></p>

If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&#x201D; But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, &#x201C;You know nothing at all. Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.&#x201D; He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.</p>

    <p>And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, &#x201C;Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;What do you want me to do for you?&#x201D;</span> And they said to him, &#x201C;Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.&#x201D; Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?&#x201D;</span> And they said to him, &#x201C;We are able.&#x201D; And Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized,</span> <span>but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.&#x201D;</span> And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. And Jesus called them to him and said to them, <span>&#x201C;You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</span> <span>But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant,</span> <span>and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.</span> <span>For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&#x201D;</span></p>

Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.</span> <span>For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves?

But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said, &#x201C;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&#x201D; He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it. Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial.</span> <span>For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <h5>Matthew 21:1-9</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, <span>&#x201C;Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.</span> <span>If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, &#x2018;The Lord needs them,&#x2019; and he will send them at once.&#x201D;</span> This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Say to the daughter of Zion,<br/>
    &#x2018;Behold, your king is coming to you,<br/>humble, and mounted on a donkey,<br/>and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them. Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, &#x201C;Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!&#x201D;</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Mark 11:1-10</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples and said to them, <span>&#x201C;Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.</span> <span>If anyone says to you, &#x2018;Why are you doing this?&#x2019; say, &#x2018;The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span> And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. And some of those standing there said to them, &#x201C;What are you doing, untying the colt?&#x201D; And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, &#x201C;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!&#x201D;</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Luke 19:28-40</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, saying, <span>&#x201C;Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here.</span> <span>If anyone asks you, &#x2018;Why are you untying it?&#x2019; you shall say this: &#x2018;The Lord has need of it.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span> So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them. And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, &#x201C;Why are you untying the colt?&#x201D; And they said, &#x201C;The Lord has need of it.&#x201D; And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road. As he was drawing near&#x2014;already on the way down the Mount of Olives&#x2014;the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying, &#x201C;Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&#x201D; And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, &#x201C;Teacher, rebuke your disciples.&#x201D; He answered, <span>&#x201C;I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.&#x201D;</span></p>
    </div>

    <h5>John 12:12-19</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, &#x201C;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!&#x201D; And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Fear not, daughter of Zion;<br/>
    behold, your king is coming,<br/>sitting on a donkey's colt!&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him. The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness. The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign. So the Pharisees said to one another, &#x201C;You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after him.&#x201D;</p>

    <h5>Matthew 21:33-46</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p><span>&#x201C;Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country.</span> <span>When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit.</span> <span>And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.</span> <span>Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them.</span> <span>Finally he sent his son to them, saying, &#x2018;They will respect my son.&#x2019;</span> <span>But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, &#x2018;This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.&#x2019;</span> <span>And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</span> <span>When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?&#x201D;</span> They said to him, &#x201C;He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Have you never read in the Scriptures:</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2018;The stone that the builders rejected<br/>has become the cornerstone;<br/>
    this was the Lord's doing,<br/>and it is marvelous in our eyes&#x2019;?</span></p></blockquote>
    <p><span>Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits.</span> <span>And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet.</p>

    <p>And he began to speak to them in parables. <span>&#x201C;A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went into another country.</span> <span>When the season came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</span> <span>And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span>Again he sent to them another servant, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully.</span> <span>And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed.</span> <span>He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, &#x2018;They will respect my son.&#x2019;</span> <span>But those tenants said to one another, &#x2018;This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.&#x2019;</span> <span>And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.</span> <span>What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.</span> <span>Have you not read this Scripture:</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2018;The stone that the builders rejected<br/>has become the cornerstone;</span><br/><span>this was the Lord's doing,<br/>and it is marvelous in our eyes&#x2019;?&#x201D;</span></p></blockquote>

    <h5>Luke 20:9-19</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And he began to tell the people this parable: <span>&#x201C;A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while.</span> <span>When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard.

But they also beat and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span>And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out.</span> <span>Then the owner of the vineyard said, &#x2018;What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.&#x2019;</span> <span>But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, &#x2018;This is the heir. Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.&#x2019;</span> <span>And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span>He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.&#x201D;</span> When they heard this, they said, &#x201C;Surely not!&#x201D; But he looked directly at them and said, <span>&#x201C;What then is this that is written:</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><span>&#x201C;&#x2018;The stone that the builders rejected<br/>has become the cornerstone&#x2019;?</span></p></blockquote>
    <p><span>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.&#x201D;</span></p>
        <p>The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people.</p>

    <p>The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, saying, &#x201C;Teacher, Moses said, &#x2018;If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.&#x2019; Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother. So too the second and third, down to the seventh. After them all, the woman died. In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>But Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.</span> <span>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <span>And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God:</span> <span>&#x2018;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#x2019;? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.&#x201D;</span> And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</p>

There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring. And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise. And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died. In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?</span> <span>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <span>And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, &#x2018;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#x2019;?</span> <span>He is not God of the dead, but of the living.

Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children. And the second and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died. Afterward the woman also died. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>And Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,</span> <span>but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,</span> <span>for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</span> <span>But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</span> <span>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.&#x201D;</span> Then some of the scribes answered, &#x201C;Teacher, you have spoken well.&#x201D; For they no longer dared to ask him any question.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, <span>&#x201C;The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat,</span> <span>so practice and observe whatever they tell you&#x2014;but not what they do. For they preach, but do not practice.</span> <span>They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger.</span> <span>They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,</span> <span>and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues</span> <span>and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others.</span> <span>But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.</span> <span>And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.</span> <span>Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ.</span> <span>The greatest among you shall be your servant.</span> <span>Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.</span> <span>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;Woe to you, blind guides, who say, &#x2018;If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.&#x2019;</span> <span>You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred?</span> <span>And you say, &#x2018;If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.&#x2019;</span> <span>You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</span> <span>So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.</span> <span>And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it.</span> <span>And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.</span> <span>You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.</span> <span>You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean.</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.</span> <span>So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous,</span> <span>saying, &#x2018;If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.&#x2019;</span> <span>Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.</span> <span>Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.</span> <span>You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?</span> <span>Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town,</span> <span>so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.</span> <span>Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.</span></p>

    <p>Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, &#x201C;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&#x201D; Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. And Jesus answered them, <span>&#x201C;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span> <span>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</span> <span>Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</span> <span>If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</span></p>
        <p><span>&#x201C;Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? &#x2018;Father, save me from this hour&#x2019;? But for this purpose I have come to this hour.</span> <span>Father, glorify your name.&#x201D;</span> Then a voice came from heaven: &#x201C;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&#x201D; The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, &#x201C;An angel has spoken to him.&#x201D; Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;This voice has come for your sake, not mine.</span> <span>Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out.</span> <span>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&#x201D;</span> He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die. So the crowd answered him, &#x201C;We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&#x201D; So Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you.

    <p>Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Lord, who has believed what he heard from us,<br/>and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;He has blinded their eyes<br/>and hardened their heart,<br/>
    lest they see with their eyes,<br/>and understand with their heart, and turn,<br/>and I would heal them.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him. Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue; for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table. And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, &#x201C;Why this waste? For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor.&#x201D; But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, <span>&#x201C;Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.</span> <span>For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</span> <span>In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial.</span> <span>Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head. There were some who said to themselves indignantly, &#x201C;Why was the ointment wasted like that? For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.&#x201D; And they scolded her. But Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span> <span>For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me.</span> <span>She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial.</span> <span>And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <h5>Luke 7:36-50</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and took his place at the table. And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, &#x201C;If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.&#x201D; And Jesus answering said to him, <span>&#x201C;Simon, I have something to say to you.&#x201D;</span> And he answered, &#x201C;Say it, Teacher.&#x201D;</p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</span> <span>When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?&#x201D;</span> Simon answered, &#x201C;The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.&#x201D; And he said to him, <span>&#x201C;You have judged rightly.&#x201D;</span> Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, <span>&#x201C;Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</span> <span>You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet.</span> <span>You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</span> <span>Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven&#x2014;for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.&#x201D;</span> And he said to her, <span>&#x201C;Your sins are forgiven.&#x201D;</span> Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, &#x201C;Who is this, who even forgives sins?&#x201D; And he said to the woman, <span>&#x201C;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <h5>John 12:1-8</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table. Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said, &#x201C;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&#x201D; He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it. Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial.</span> <span>For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <h5>John 13:1-20</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, &#x201C;Lord, do you wash my feet?&#x201D; Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.&#x201D;</span> Peter said to him, &#x201C;You shall never wash my feet.&#x201D; Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.&#x201D;</span> Simon Peter said to him, &#x201C;Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!&#x201D; Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.&#x201D;</span> For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, <span>&#x201C;Not all of you are clean.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Do you understand what I have done to you?</span> <span>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</span> <span>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.</span> <span>For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.</span> <span>Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</span> <span>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span> <span>I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, &#x2018;He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.&#x2019;</span> <span>I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he.</span> <span>Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.&#x201D;</span></p>

One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table close to Jesus, so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, &#x201C;Lord, who is it?&#x201D; Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.&#x201D;</span> So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.

Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, &#x201C;Buy what we need for the feast,&#x201D; or that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p>

One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table close to Jesus, so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, &#x201C;Lord, who is it?&#x201D; Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.&#x201D;</span> So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;What you are going to do, do quickly.&#x201D;</span> Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, &#x201C;Buy what we need for the feast,&#x201D; or that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p>

    <p>When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, <span>&#x201C;Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you,</span> <span>since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him.</span> <span>And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.</span> <span>I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.</span> <span>And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.</span> <span>Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you.</span> <span>For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me.</span> <span>I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.</span> <span>All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.</span> <span>And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one.</span> <span>While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> <span>But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</span> <span>I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.</span> <span>I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.</span> <span>They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.</span> <span>Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.</span> <span>As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.</span> <span>And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.</span></p>
    <p><span>&#x201C;I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word,</span> <span>that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.</span> <span>The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one,</span> <span>I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me.</span> <span>Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.</span> <span>O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me.</span> <span>I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.&#x201D;</span></p>

But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.&#x201D;</span></p>

    <p>Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, <span>&#x201C;Whom do you seek?&#x201D;</span> They answered him, &#x201C;Jesus of Nazareth.&#x201D; Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;I am he.&#x201D;</span> Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;I am he,&#x201D;</span> they drew back and fell to the ground. So he asked them again, <span>&#x201C;Whom do you seek?&#x201D;</span> And they said, &#x201C;Jesus of Nazareth.&#x201D; Jesus answered, <span>&#x201C;I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.&#x201D;</span> This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: <span>&#x201C;Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.&#x201D;</span> Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) So Jesus said to Peter, <span>&#x201C;Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?&#x201D;</span></p>
        <p>So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.</p>

    <h5>Matthew 26:57-68</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and said, &#x201C;This man said, &#x2018;I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.&#x2019;&#x201D; And the high priest stood up and said, &#x201C;Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?&#x201D; But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, &#x201C;I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.&#x201D; Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#x201D;</span> Then the high priest tore his robes and said, &#x201C;He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?&#x201D; They answered, &#x201C;He deserves death.&#x201D; Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, saying, &#x201C;Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?&#x201D;</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Mark 14:53-65</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire. Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none. For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree. And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, &#x201C;We heard him say, &#x2018;I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.&#x2019;&#x201D; Yet even about this their testimony did not agree. And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, &#x201C;Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?&#x201D; But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, &#x201C;Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&#x201D; And Jesus said, <span>&#x201C;I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.&#x201D;</span> And the high priest tore his garments and said, &#x201C;What further witnesses do we need? You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?&#x201D; And they all condemned him as deserving death. And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, &#x201C;Prophesy!&#x201D; And the guards received him with blows.</p>

    <h5>Luke 22:54-71</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house, and Peter was following at a distance. And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, &#x201C;This man also was with him.&#x201D; But he denied it, saying, &#x201C;Woman, I do not know him.&#x201D; And a little later someone else saw him and said, &#x201C;You also are one of them.&#x201D; But Peter said, &#x201C;Man, I am not.&#x201D; And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, &#x201C;Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.&#x201D; But Peter said, &#x201C;Man, I do not know what you are talking about.&#x201D; And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, <span>&#x201C;Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.&#x201D;</span> And he went out and wept bitterly.</p>
        <p>Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him. They also blindfolded him and kept asking him, &#x201C;Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?&#x201D; And they said many other things against him, blaspheming him.</p>
        <p>When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. And they led him away to their council, and they said, &#x201C;If you are the Christ, tell us.&#x201D; But he said to them, <span>&#x201C;If I tell you, you will not believe,</span> <span>and if I ask you, you will not answer.</span> <span>But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&#x201D;</span> So they all said, &#x201C;Are you the Son of God, then?&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;You say that I am.&#x201D;</span> Then they said, &#x201C;What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.&#x201D;</p>

    <h5>John 18:13-24</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>First they led him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.</p>
        <p>Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest, but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in. The servant girl at the door said to Peter, &#x201C;You also are not one of this man's disciples, are you?&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;I am not.&#x201D; Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</p>
        <p>The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.</span> <span>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.&#x201D;</span> When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, &#x201C;Is that how you answer the high priest?&#x201D; Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?&#x201D;</span> Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</p>

    <p>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.

When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer. The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</p>

    <p>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, &#x201C;Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&#x201D; For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, &#x201C;Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.&#x201D; Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor again said to them, &#x201C;Which of the two do you want me to release for you?&#x201D; And they said, &#x201C;Barabbas.&#x201D; Pilate said to them, &#x201C;Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&#x201D; They all said, &#x201C;Let him be crucified!&#x201D; And he said, &#x201C;Why, what evil has he done?&#x201D; But they shouted all the more, &#x201C;Let him be crucified!&#x201D;</p>

    <p>Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. And he answered them, saying, &#x201C;Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&#x201D; For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. And Pilate again said to them, &#x201C;Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?&#x201D; And they cried out again, &#x201C;Crucify him.&#x201D; And Pilate said to them, &#x201C;Why, what evil has he done?&#x201D; But they shouted all the more, &#x201C;Crucify him.&#x201D;</p>

They came up to him, saying, &#x201C;Hail, King of the Jews!&#x201D; and struck him with their hands. Pilate went out again and said to them, &#x201C;See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him.&#x201D; So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &#x201C;Behold the man!&#x201D; When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, &#x201C;Crucify him, crucify him!&#x201D; Pilate said to them, &#x201C;Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.&#x201D; The Jews answered him, &#x201C;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God.&#x201D; When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid. He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, &#x201C;Where are you from?&#x201D; But Jesus gave him no answer. So Pilate said to him, &#x201C;You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?&#x201D; Jesus answered him, <span>&#x201C;You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, &#x201C;If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.&#x201D; So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, &#x201C;Behold your King!&#x201D; They cried out, &#x201C;Away with him, away with him, crucify him!&#x201D; Pilate said to them, &#x201C;Shall I crucify your King?&#x201D; The chief priests answered, &#x201C;We have no king but Caesar.&#x201D;</p>

    <p>and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, &#x201C;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&#x201D; Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &#x201C;Do not write, &#x2018;The King of the Jews,&#x2019; but rather, &#x2018;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&#x2019;&#x201D; Pilate answered, &#x201C;What I have written I have written.&#x201D;</p>
    <p>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, so they said to one another, &#x201C;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.&#x201D; This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;They divided my garments among them,<br/>and for my clothing they cast lots.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>So the soldiers did these things, but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <span>&#x201C;Woman, behold, your son!&#x201D;</span> Then he said to the disciple, <span>&#x201C;Behold, your mother!&#x201D;</span> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</p>

    <p>Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witness&#x2014;his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth&#x2014;that you also may believe.

    <p>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock.

Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</p>

This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid. It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning. The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments.</p>

So he came and took away his body. Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</p>

    <p>Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you.&#x201D; So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. And they were saying to one another, &#x201C;Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?&#x201D; And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back&#x2014;it was very large. And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. And he said to them, &#x201C;Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.&#x201D; And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</p>

    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, &#x201C;Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.&#x201D; And they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>John 20:1-13</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &#x201C;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.&#x201D; So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there, and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples went back to their homes.</p>
        <p>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. They said to her, &#x201C;Woman, why are you weeping?&#x201D; She said to them, &#x201C;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&#x201D;</p>

    <h5>Luke 24:13-35</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?&#x201D;</span> And they stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, &#x201C;Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;What things?&#x201D;</span> And they said to him, &#x201C;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&#x201D;</span> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
    <p>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, but they urged him strongly, saying, &#x201C;Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.&#x201D; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &#x201C;Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?&#x201D; And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying, &#x201C;The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&#x201D; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p>

    <p>After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way. Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them, &#x201C;I am going fishing.&#x201D; They said to him, &#x201C;We will go with you.&#x201D; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>
    <p>Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Children, do you have any fish?&#x201D;</span> They answered him, &#x201C;No.&#x201D; He said to them, <span>&#x201C;Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&#x201D;</span> So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, &#x201C;It is the Lord!&#x201D; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea. The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.</p>
    <p>When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&#x201D;</span> So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Come and have breakfast.&#x201D;</span> Now none of the disciples dared ask him, &#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D; They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</p>

    <h5>Mark 1 Corinthians 15:3-8</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
    <p>As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&#x201C;Behold, I send my messenger before your face,<br/>who will prepare your way,<br/>
    the voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br/>&#x2018;Prepare the way of the Lord,<br/>make his paths straight,&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote>
    <p>John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, &#x201C;After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, &#x201C;You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.&#x201D;</p>
        <p>The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.</p>
        <p>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, <span>&#x201C;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.&#x201D;</span></p>
        <p>Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.&#x201D;</span> And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.</p>
        <p>And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, &#x201C;What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are&#x2014;the Holy One of God.&#x201D; But Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span>&#x201C;Be silent, and come out of him!&#x201D;</span> And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, &#x201C;What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.&#x201D; And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.</p>
        <p>And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.</p>
    <p>That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. And the whole city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</p>
        <p>And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed. And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, and they found him and said to him, &#x201C;Everyone is looking for you.&#x201D; And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.&#x201D;</span> And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</p>
        <p>And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, &#x201C;If you will, you can make me clean.&#x201D; Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, <span>&#x201C;I will; be clean.&#x201D;</span> And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, and said to him, <span>&#x201C;See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.&#x201D;</span> But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.</p>
    <p>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.</p>

        <p>After these things he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country. And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.</p>
        <p>Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. And he said to them, <span>&#x201C;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.</span> <span>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.</span> <span>And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</span> <span>they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs.]]</p>

    <p>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, <span>&#x201C;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</span> <span>Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.

    <h5>John 21:1-25</h5>
    <div class="esv-text">
    <p>After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way. Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them, &#x201C;I am going fishing.&#x201D; They said to him, &#x201C;We will go with you.&#x201D; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>
    <p>Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Children, do you have any fish?&#x201D;</span> They answered him, &#x201C;No.&#x201D; He said to them, <span>&#x201C;Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&#x201D;</span> So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, &#x201C;It is the Lord!&#x201D; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea. The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.</p>
    <p>When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&#x201D;</span> So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, <span>&#x201C;Come and have breakfast.&#x201D;</span> Now none of the disciples dared ask him, &#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D; They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</p>
        <p>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span>&#x201C;Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?&#x201D;</span> He said to him, &#x201C;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&#x201D; He said to him, <span>&#x201C;Feed my lambs.&#x201D;</span> He said to him a second time, <span>&#x201C;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&#x201D;</span> He said to him, &#x201C;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&#x201D; He said to him, <span>&#x201C;Tend my sheep.&#x201D;</span> He said to him the third time, <span>&#x201C;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&#x201D;</span> Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, <span>&#x201C;Do you love me?&#x201D;</span> and he said to him, &#x201C;Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.&#x201D; Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;Feed my sheep.</span> <span>Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.&#x201D;</span> (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, <span>&#x201C;Follow me.&#x201D;</span></p>
        <p>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had been reclining at table close to him and had said, &#x201C;Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?&#x201D; When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, &#x201C;Lord, what about this man?&#x201D; Jesus said to him, <span>&#x201C;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!&#x201D;</span> So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, <span>&#x201C;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?&#x201D;</span></p>
    <p>This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</p>
    <p>Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</p>
